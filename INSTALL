How to build and install:

./pre-build && ./configure && make && sudo make install

And that's it.

In detail:

Generate the configure and various Makfile files:

    ./pre-build

Gather the configuration of the current system for the build

    ./configure

Build the binaries

    make

Install the binaries

    sudo make install

Debug install:

To generate debug binaries, the "build" and "install" steps above can be replaced by:

    ./make-debug

a.k.a:

    make CFLAGS="-O0 -g" CXXFLAGS="-O0 -g"

    sudo make install CFLAGS="-O0 -g" CXXFLAGS="-O0 -g"
